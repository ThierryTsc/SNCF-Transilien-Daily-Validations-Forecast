# SNCF-Transilien-Daily-Validations-Forecast
This project addresses the SNCF-Transilien challenge of forecasting daily validations at 448 train stations using historical time series (2015–2022) and exogenous variables (job, holiday, vacation). The goal is to predict validations for January–June 2023, helping optimize service planning and operational performance.
